Plum Bot
========

A multipurpose bot with lots of fun commands and utilities.

Plum Bot allows your server to more simply manage the users and the permissions.
And of course, it inherited features such as the powerful config system and the polish of the
commands from other popular bots, like Koopa and Super Mario, from the same author.

## Features

* Logging
* Fun games you can play to pass some time (including the popular Minesweeper and Hangman)
* Points system
* Voting
* Reliable reminder system

And if something bad happens, a unique code will be generated which'll help developers fix it in no time!
Oh, and if you ping the bot, it'll remind you of the prefix!
